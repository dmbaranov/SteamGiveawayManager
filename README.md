# SteamGiveawayManager
This is a Bot Manager that helps you to control all of your bots which enter giveaways instead of you. You can easily add more bots if you whish. In order to start using this manager you should:

1. Visit every giveaway website, get it cookies and add it to settings.ini. E.g. for steamgifts you should use PHPSESSID and _ga, order doesn't matter.
2. In folder with .py files open terminal and type in: ``python main.py`` These scripts were tested with python3.5
3. If everything is ok, bots will load settings and start enter giveaways, otherwise you can open an issue and report a bug there.
